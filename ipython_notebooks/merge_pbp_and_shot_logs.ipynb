    "One of the great things about all the publically available data is it has created opportunities for people with some programming skills and some creativity to merge different data sets and create new data sets for deeper more complex analysis. A good, recent example of this is the [positional estimates](http://nyloncalculus.com/2015/09/22/nba-position-estimates-2014-15/) from Seth Partnow. A lot can be done using nothing more than publically available data, an idea for how to transform this data into something new and useful and some coding skills to put it together (and some frustration when your idea doesn't work as originally planned on the first try). As anyone who has worked a lot with data will tell you, the hardest part is not the analysis itself but getting and organizing the data into a format that you can use to perform that analysis. This article will show you how to do just that with one of the most used data sets here at Nylon Calculus - the detailed shot logs created by merging the player tracking shot logs with play by play data. This allows you to include things like who assisted on the shot and who blocked the shot. Since this links the shot logs to the play by play, you can also [figure out who was on the floor](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dblackrun/nba/blob/master/ipython_notebooks/pbp_with_players_on_court.ipynb) for each shot as well as the prior event. I will show you how to merge these two data sets for one player in one quarter, but you can expand on this and do it for the entire season. I will be doing this using Python 2.7. If you are more familiar with R this can still be of use to you since the steps and logic would be exactly the same."

    "Now that we have the data for the quarter from both data sets we can combine them. The logical step is to combine them where the time is the same in both data sets. Take a look at the PCTIMESTRING column from the play by play data and the GAME_CLOCK column from the shot logs column. These columns both represent the time remaining in the quarter. You will notice that they don't match up and are a few seconds off. The first shot in the player tracking logs was taken with 10:22 remaining and in the the play by play it was taken with 10:18 remaining. You will notice that for all shots the time is off by 3-4 seconds. This makes things a little more challenging since we can't just merge where play by play time equals shot log time. Since they are only off by a few seconds we can just compare the times and merge them when they are within a few seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things easier, we should convert the times from mm:ss format to just the number of seconds remaining in the period. So if the time is 1:30 we will convert it to 90. Another thing we should do is order both by time. Since there are cases where a player may shoot twice within a few seconds, if we only look at the time and keep shots within a few seconds we might link a shot in the shot logs to multiple shots in the play by play. If we order the shots by time and only compare the first shot in the shot logs with the first shot in the play by play, and so on, then we can prevent this from happening."

The above method can be tweaked to improve this to 99.4% of shots.
