    "It's been two years since [stats.nba.com](http://stats.nba.com) first rolled out their [SportVU player tracking](http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/) stats. As great as these stats are, there was one thing that many people who have spent a lot of time working with this data felt was missing - the ability to filter these stats by date. Fortunately, a few days ago an update was made that included this feature. Up until now we could just see per game averages for all these stats but with this new update we can now get a breakdown for all these stats on a day by day basis. In this post I will walk through how to use the date filtering feature to get game logs for the one of these SportVU stat categories for a single day using Python 2.7. If you want to do some digging to a full season's worth of these stats you can build upon this to get these game logs for all the stats for a full season."

Below is the base URL for the player tracking stats along with the needed parameters. The key parameters we need to set are DateFrom, DateTo, PlayerOrTeam, PtMeasureType, Season and SeasonType. Most of these should be pretty self explanatory. The PtMeasureType parameter is just the player tracking stat we want to get. For this example we will get the possessions/touches stats. There are a lot of parameters that are blank that you can play around with as you see fit, but for making the game logs they aren't needed."

    "Now we have the game logs for the day's games.  Most of these column names should be pretty self explanatory but if you ever need to check to see what a heading means you can just mouse over the header on the [stat page](http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/possessions/) to get a more detailed description. To get the game logs for a different stat you just need to change the PtMeasureType parameter when getting the player tracking data. To get the full season's game logs you can just loop through all the days of the season and run this for each day. If you have any questions feel free to ask me on [Twitter.](http://twitter.com/bballport)"
